I am Daisy Lou Montante. You can call me Monay.
I created this repository 9 months ago.

From this day (Feb 23, 2025) I performed some changes (created a Dockerfile, 
adding READM.md, docker-compose.yml, and writing test cases using pytest). 
For my Activity 4.1 a hands-on assignment: Implementing CI/CD in Software Engineering.
The subject is Software Engineering 2.

These are the steps I have followed:

## 1. Project Repository Setup

- Cloned an existing repository (blogpost-django).
- Ensured proper repository structure:
  - `src/` - Contains the source code of the web application.
  - `tests/` - Includes test cases.
  - `Dockerfile` - Defines containerization steps.
  - `README.md` - Explains the project purpose and setup instructions.

## 2. Writing Test Cases

- Implemented at least two test cases using an appropriate testing framework.
- Used:
  - **Pytest** (for Python)
- Verified tests by running them locally:
  ```sh
  # Example for Python with Pytest
  pytest test/
  ```

## 3. Configuring CI/CD Pipeline

- Created a CI/CD configuration file:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (for GitHub Actions)
- Configured the pipeline to:
  - Run test cases on every push or pull request.
  - Build the application (if applicable).
  - Optionally deploy the application to **Heroku/AWS/Docker Compose/local server**.

## 4. Executing and Debugging the CI/CD Pipeline

- Pushed changes to the repository and verified the pipeline execution.
- Debugged errors by reviewing logs and making necessary fixes.
- Ensured a successful execution of the pipeline.

## 5. Documentation and Submission

- Documented the setup and steps followed.
- Included screenshots of:
  - Successful test runs.
  - CI/CD pipeline execution.

## 6. Submission

- Submitted the GitHub repository link containing:
  - Source code.
  - CI/CD configuration.
  - `REPORT.md` file.
  - Screenshots of successful runs.
